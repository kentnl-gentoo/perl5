How to build

1. setup VC environment (VCVARS32)
2. make sure you are in the win32 subdirectory
3. NMAKE

The resulting perl.exe , perl.dll, perlglob.exe would be put
under the main directory.

the LIB subdirectory is also properly handled which can be
copy to the final location. If you make the directory structure as
the following :

perl.exe
perl.dll
perlglob.exe
LIB\.....	here goes all the module stuff


you can save the PERLLIB= line in the environment. this port would
search the LIB sub-directory where the perl.dll is located. 


That's it
