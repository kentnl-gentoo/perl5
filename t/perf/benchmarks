#!perl

# This file specifies a hash-of-hashes that define snippets of code that
# can be run by various measurement and profiling tools.
#
# The basic idea is that any time you add an optimisation that is intended
# to make a particular construct faster, then you should add that construct
# to this file.
#
# Under the normal test suite, the test file benchmarks.t does a basic
# compile and run of each of these snippets; not to test performance,
# but just to ensure that the code doesn't have errors.
#
# Over time, it is intended that various measurement and profiling tools
# will be written that can run selected (or all) snippets in various
# environments. These will not be run as part of a normal test suite run.
#
# This file is designed to be read in by 'do' (and in such a way that
# multiple versions of this file from different releases can be read in
# by a single process).
#
# Each key of the top-level hash is a token that describes a particular
# test. Code will be compiled in the package named after the token, so it
# should match /^\w+$/a. It is intended that this can be used on the
# command line of tools to select particular tests, .
#
# Each value is also a hash, with three fields:
#
#   desc is a description of the test
#   setup is a string containing setup code
#   code  is a string containing the code to run in a loop
#
# So typically a benchmark tool might do something like
#
#   eval "package $token; $setup; for (1..1000000) { $code }"
