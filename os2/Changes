after 5.003_05:
	PERLLIB_PREFIX was not active if it matches an element of @INC
		as a whole.
	Do not need PERL_SBRK if crtdll-revision is >= 50.
	Use -Zsmall-conv if crtdll-revision is >= 50 (in static perl!).
:7: warning: #warning <dirent.h> requires <sys/types.h>
	We compile miniperl static. It cannot fork, thus there may be
		problems with pipes (since HAS_FORK is in
		place). Pipes are required by makemaker.
	We compile perl___.exe A.OUT and dynamic. It should be able to
		fork.
	If we can fork, we my_popen by popen unless "-|". Thus we
		write a cooky "-1" into the pid array to indicate
		this.
	Apparently we can fork, and we can load dynamic extensions
		now, though probably not simultaneously.
	*DB tests corrected for OS/2 one-user stat[2].
	/bin/sh is intercepted and replaced by SH_PATH.
	Note that having '\\' in the command line of one-arg `system'
		would trigger call via shell.
	Segfault with system {'ls'} 'blah'; corrected.
	Documentation of OS/2-different features added to main PODs.
	New buitins in Cwd::

		Cwd::current_drive
		Cwd::sys_chdir		- leaves drive as it is.
		Cwd::change_drive
		Cwd::sys_is_absolute	- has drive letter and is_rooted
		Cwd::sys_is_rooted	- has leading [/\\] (maybe
					  after a drive)
		Cwd::sys_is_relative	- changes with current dir
		Cwd::sys_cwd		- Interface to cwd from EMX.
		Cwd::sys_abspath(name, dir)	
					- Really really odious
					  function. Returns absolute
					  name of file which would 
					  have 'name' if CWD were 'dir'.
					Dir defaults to the current dir.
		Cwd::extLibpath [type]	- Get/set current value of extended
		Cwd::extLibpath_set	- library search path.
			path [type]
					The optional last argument redirects
					   to END-path if true,
					   default is to search BEGIN-path.
		(Note that some of these may be moved to different
		  libraries - eventually).
	Executables: 
		perl - can fork, can dynalink (but not simultaneously)
		perl_ - can fork, cannot dynalink
		perl__ - same as perl___, but PM.
		perl___ - cannot fork, can dynalink.
	The build of the first one - perl - is rather convoluted, and
	  requires a build of miniperl_.

after 5.003_07:
	custom tmpfile and tmpname which may use $TMP, $TEMP.
	all the calls to OS/2 API wrapped so that it is safe to use
		them under DOS (may die(), though).
	Tested that popen works under DOS with modified PDKSH and RSX.
	File::Copy works under DOS.
	MakeMaker modified to work under DOS (perlmain.c.tmp and sh -c true).
