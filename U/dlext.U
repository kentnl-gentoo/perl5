?X:  To create a shared library, you must compile ALL source files in the
?X:  library with +z (or possibly +Z if the library is whopping huge),
?X:  then link the library with -b.  Example:
?X:	  cc -c +z module_a.c
?X:	  cc -c +z module_b.c
?X:	  ld -b module_a.o module_b.o -o module.sl

On a few systems, the dynamically loaded modules that perl generates and uses
will need a different extension then shared libs. The default will probably
be appropriate.
