?X: 
?X:  To create a shared library, you must compile ALL source files in the
?X:  library with +z (or possibly +Z if the library is whopping huge),
?X:  then link the library with -b.  Example:
?X:	  cc -c +z module_a.c
?X:	  cc -c +z module_b.c
?X:	  ld -b module_a.o module_b.o -o module.sl

?S:usedl:
?S:	This variable indicates if the the system supports dynamic
?S:	loading of some sort.  See also dlsrc and dlobj.
?S:.
?S:ld:
?S:	This variable indicates the program to be used to link
?S:	libraries for dynamic loading.  On some systems, it is 'ld'.
?S:	On ELF systems, it should be $cc.  Mostly, we'll try to respect
?S:	the hint file setting.
?S:.
?S:dlsrc:
?S:	This variable contains the name of the dynamic loading file that
?S:	will be used with the package.
?S:.
?S:cccdlflags:
?S:	This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
?S:	passed with cc -c to compile modules to be used to create a shared
?S:	library that will be used for dynamic loading.  For hpux, this 
?S:	should be +z.  It is up to the makefile to use it.
?S:.
?S:lddlflags:
?S:	This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
?S:	passed to $ld to create a shared library suitable for dynamic
?S:	loading.  It is up to the makefile to use it.  For hpux, it
?S:	should be -b.  For sunos 4.1, it is empty.
?S:.
?S:ccdlflags:
?S:	This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
?S:	passed to cc to link with a shared library for dynamic loading. 
?S:	It is up to the makefile to use it.  For sunos 4.1, it should
?S:	be empty.
?S:.
?S:d_shrplib:
?S:	This variable indicates whether libperl should be made as a
?S:	shared library.  This must be true for dynamic loading to
?S:	work on (some) System V Release 4 systems.
?S:.
?S:shrpdir:
?S:	This variable contains the directory where the libperl shared
?S:	library will be installed.  LD_RUN_PATH is set to this when
?S:	linking with libperl (unless it is /usr/lib, the default).
?S:.
?C:USE_DYNAMIC_LOADING ~ %<:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, indicates that dynamic loading of
?C:	some sort is available.
